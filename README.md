# Multiplayer Physics
### A physics engine running on a nodejs server
- `npm run test` runs the [test.ts](https://github.com/leakin24mpa/Multiplayer-Physics/blob/main/src/server/test.ts) file (I use this for testing/debugging)
- `npm run build` compiles the typescript files to javascript
- `npm run start` runs the server locally on your computer. You can connect to it at `localhost:3000`
